Description  Popup is not populated by mouse ations on light weight components without mouse listener. 
Like The JLabel does not show Popup menu when right clicked, for the popup to show we have to add a empty mouse listener to the JLabel. 
 
Work Around  N/A
 
Evaluation  



The reason here is that any lightweight component that does not have at least
one mouse listener attached will not receive mouse events. This means that
even AWTEventListener added directly to the Toolkit will receive this event
as if it occured on the nearest parent of this component which do have a mouse
listener or is heavyweigth.

The idea of the suggested fix is to modify the
JComponent.setComponentPopupMenu() to enable mouse events on the lightweight
component if user passes not a null value as parameter. This will tell the 
LightWeightDispatcher to deliver events to this copmponent even if this
component does not have mouse listeners.
